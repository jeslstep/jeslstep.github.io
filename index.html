		<h2> Work Experience 
		</h2>
			<p> <b> UPS, MINNESOTA JUNE 2018 - CURRENT </b>
			</p>
			<p> I unload packages weighting 30 to 60 pounds out of trucks. I sort the packages
			 depending on their destination and priority. 
			</p>
			<p> <b> STEPHENS FARM, PALISADE, MINNESOTA SUMMERS 2010 - 2016 </b>
			</p>
			<p> During the summer hay season, I cut, raked, and baled hay using a tractor. Also, 
			  transported bales from multiple fields back to the hay storage shed on the farm. The 
			  electric fences required biweekly maintenance; I walked along the fence lines removing 
			  any tree branches and would cut away any tall grass so that the lines would no lose power. 
			</p>
			<p> <b> GREAT RIVER GARDENS, AITKIN, MINNESOTA JUNE 2010 - JULY 2011 </b>
			</p>
			<p> I potted and watered plants. Checked to make sure plants were healthy and not in need of 
				 water. Organized plants in alphabetical order, filled orders, and checked on the water pump 
			 	 to ensure it would operate every day. In the office, I filed receipts, correspondences,
			 	 and helped customers.
