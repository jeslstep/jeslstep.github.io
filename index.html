				<p align="center"> <b> STEPHENS FARM, PALISADE, MINNESOTA SUMMERS 2010 - 2016 </b>
				</p>
				<p align="center"> During the summer hay season, I cut, raked, and baled hay using a tractor. Also, 
			 		<br/> transported bales from multiple fields back to the hay storage shed on the farm. The 
			 		<br/> electric fences required biweekly maintenance; I walked along the fence lines removing 
			 		<br/> any tree branches and would cut away any tall grass so that the lines would no lose power. 
				</p>
				<p align="center"> <b> GREAT RIVER GARDENS, AITKIN, MINNESOTA JUNE 2010 - JULY 2011 </b>
				</p>
				<p align="center"> I potted and watered plants. Checked to make sure plants were healthy and not in need of 
					<br/> water. Organized plants in alphabetical order, filled orders, and checked on the water pump 
			 		<br/> to ensure it would operate every day. In the office, I filed receipts, correspondences,
			 		<br/> and helped customers.
